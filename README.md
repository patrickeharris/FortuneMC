# fortunemc
A little plugin I made for the factions server FortuneMC to fix some issues with raiding.
Changes the following for factions on FortuneMC to create a better raiding system than vanilla Minecraft offers:

1. Players will not be teleported when eating chorus fruit within 8 blocks of obsidian making obsidian bases immune to chorus fruit raiding.
2. Players will not be able to place blocks above the nether roof as a glitch (against the rules of FortuneMC) is required to get above the nether roof.
3. Players will not be damaged from hitting each other with fishing rods as doing so can kick the player through a layer of blocks above them which can be used to get into faction bases with minimal effort.
4. Players will not be able to use ender pearls while flying as doing so can glitch players through walls enabling players to get into faction bases with minimal effort.

The plugin also includes a customizable, modular, hot-swappable system which allows any of the above changes to be enabled or disabled from in-game with commands.
